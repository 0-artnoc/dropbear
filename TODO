Current:

Things which might need doing:

- Make options.h generated from configure perhaps?

- Improved queueing of unauthed connections

- fix agent fwd problems

- improve channel window adjustment algorithm (circular buffering)

- check that there aren't timing issues with valid/invalid user authentication
  feedback.

- Binding to different interfaces

- possible RSA blinding? need to check whether this is vuln to timing attacks
- check PRNG
- CTR mode, SSH_MSG_IGNORE sending to improve CBC security
- DH Group Exchange possibly, or just add group14 (whatever it's called today)

- Use m_burn for clearing sensitive items in LTM/LTC

- fix scp.c for IRIX
